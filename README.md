#Binary Classification of Footwear
Cross-validation pipeline to train and test Neural Networks and SVMs.

The code shows a k-fold cross validation implemantation to train different ML models.
For this experimentation SVMs with linear and gausian kernels were selected together with a variety of neural networks with several hidden layers configuration.

Intructions to Code.ipynb:

1. Open Code.ipynb in a Jupyter enviroment

2. Make sure moist_reader.py and fashion are in the same directory as Code.ipynb or adjust the directory pat if necessary in the second cell instead of just "fashion".

3. Run all cells to execute the code and see the results.

Ps: Some of the methods took a very long time to execute and for some experimentations the optimization did not converged.
